    <h1 class="govuk-heading-xl">Tell us about your costs</h1>

    <p class="govuk-body">
        You'll need to tell us about the costs you've already incurred and will incur in future stages of the works. This must include costs that have been covered by any pre tender support payments already received.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        All costs should be submitted excluding VAT. When you've completed your claim you'll be able to include an entry for irrecoverable VAT, VAT that you are not able to claim back.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        If you are a local authority or a registered provider, please ensure you include the full, actual costs of works and do not apply any apportionments to the costs. Your grant award will be calculated to reflect 
        the proportion of units that are eligible for funding as part of the review process. Submitting incorrect costs may result in a delay to your application or an incorrect grant award calculation.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
        If it helps, you can download a template to share with your project team. You'll need to input the information with us in the following pages.
