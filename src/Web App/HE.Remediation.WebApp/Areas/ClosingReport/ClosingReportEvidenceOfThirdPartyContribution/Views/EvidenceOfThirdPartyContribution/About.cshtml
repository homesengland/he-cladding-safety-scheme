<p class="govuk-body">
    In this section we will ask you to record and supply evidence for all attempts at securing third party contributions.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
    As a recipient of public funds, clause 5.4 of your grant funding agreement requires you to make reasonable attempts to recover the costs of remediation from other sources, such as the original developer, contractors or warranties/insurance.
</p>


<p class="govuk-body">
    We will also ask you to provide the details of all other recovery attempts, including any that are in progress or not yet started. You must include the details of the third party, dates and the outcome, along with supporting evidence.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
    If there were no opportunities to recover funds, please provide evidence to that effect.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
    For further information, please refer to the guidance.
